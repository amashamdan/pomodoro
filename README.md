Pomodoro Clock
===========================================================

Welcome to Pomodoro Clock. Pomodoro clock helps you manage your time by breaking down work into intervals, session and break.

Typically, a session interval is 25 minutes long while a break interval is 5 minutes. In this clock, the length of the intervals is customizable.

How to use
===========================================================

Setting the session and break intervals: The user can enter the interval (in minutes) in the corresponding text input fields. Additionally, the user can use + and - button to increment or decrement the time respectively. If the user do not set the time, default values are used. Deafult values are 25 minutes session and 5 minutes break.

Note: The entered values for session and break should be integers. If the user enters a non-integer, the values will be floored.

Starting (resuming)/pausing the timer: To start the timer, simply click on it. Clicking on the timer while its running will pause it. To resume the timer after a pause, click on it again and it will resume.

Resetting the timer: To reset the timer, click on Reset. Once Reset is clicked, the timer will go back to session mode, and the time will be set to the entered value or the default value.
